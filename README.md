# CTAB-GAN
This git is built for paper [CTAB-GAN: Effective Table Data Synthesizing](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v157/zhao21a.html). The paper is published on Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2021), please check our pdf on PMLR website for our newest version of [paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v157/zhao21a.html), it adds more content on time consumption analysis of training CTAB-GAN. Since part of our code is commercialized, we still need to figure out some legal issues to release the code. Therefore, code is conditionaly available for now. Please contact `z.zhao-8@tudelft.nl` for more information.

We will keep updating this github.
